# CSCE 313
All of the work I did for CSCE 313 (Intro to Operating Systems). My milestone 2 for Machine problem 1 did not work but it did compile so
be warned of that. Otherwise, everything else should work. The makefiles will take care of compiling the programs.

As always, don't copy the code for Aggie Honor Code reasons. Just use as a reference.
